Thermo-mechanical phase-field modelling of thermal fracture

The phase-field modeling of thermal fracture is proposed based on thermodynamically consistant derivation. The model is implemented with finite elment method within MOOSE, where the staggered algorthim is used. The "elasticity.i" is used for thermo-mechanical analysis and the "fracture.i" for fracture calculation.
